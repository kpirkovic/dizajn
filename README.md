# Dizajn.mk - Web Design & Development Project
Dizajn is a social media network with a blog-like interface designed for designers in Macedonia to share their knowledge of design, graphics, and software.

To complete my introduction to the coding course as part of my web design Bootcamp at SEDC, I was required to develop a project using solely HTML and CSS.

Dribble, Behance, and a few other blogging platforms for design inspired the concept for this website.

It was incredibly enjoyable to work on this project. I tested the boundaries of what is possible only using CSS without utilizing JS, and I gained a lot of knowledge about HTML and CSS.

Note: Because this project does not contain any JavaScript, the filters on the live site are not functional.
